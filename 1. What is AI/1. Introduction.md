# Introduction

AI is estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030.

## Demystifying AI

AI is actually two separate ideas

1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence

    * Almost all the progress we are seeing in the AI today is artificial narrow intelligence. These are AIs that do one thing such as a smart speaker or a self-driving car or AI to do web search or AI applications in farming or in a factory.

2. Artificial General Intelligence

    * That is the goal to build AI. They can do anything a human can do or maybe even be superintelligence and do even more things than any human can.
