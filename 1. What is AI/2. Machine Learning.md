# Machine Learning

1. Supervised Learning
The most commonly used type of Machine Learning is a typeof AI that learns A to B or input to output mappings.

A ------------------------------------> B
Or
Input --------------------------------> Output

**_Example:_**
|Input(A)                 |Output(B)                    |Application                           |
|:---                     |:---                         |:----:                                |
|email                    |spam? (0/1)                  |spam Filtering                        |
|audio                    |Text Transcript              |speech Recognition                    |
|English                  |Chinese                      |machine translation                   |
