### Machine Learning

* If you want to build a mobile app to help people price houses. Then, this would be a machine-learning system, and particular would be one of those machine learning systems that learns inputs to outputs, or A to B mappings. So, machine learning often results in a running AI system e.g websites/ mobile app.

* AI system running, serving dozens or hundreds of thousands of millions of users, that's usually a machine-learning system.

* By _Arthur Samuel (1959)_ “Machine Learning is a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” => Software

### Data Science

* If you want to have a team to analyze your dataset in order to gain insights. **The output of a data science project is a set of insights that can help you make business decisions**, such as what type of house to build or whether to invest in renovation.

* Data science is the science of extracting knowledge and insights from data in the form of:
  * slide deck
  * The presentation summarizes conclusions for executives to take business actions
  * Summarizes conclusions for a product team to decide how to improve a website.
