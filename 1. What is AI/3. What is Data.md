# What is Data

As we know data is very important for AI Systems. But, What is data really? Let's look at an example of a table of data which we also call a dataset.

**_Example of a table of data_**

* So, if you're trying to build a AI system or Machine Learning system to help you set prices for houses or figure out if a house is priced appropriately, you might decide that the size of the house is A and the price of the house is B, and have an AI system learn this input to output or A to B mapping.
  
| Size of House (Square Feet) |       | Price ($1000) |
| :-------------------------: | :---: | :-----------: |
|             523             |       |      115      |
|             645             |       |      150      |
|             708             |       |      210      |
|             1034            |       |      280      |
|             2290            |       |      355      |
|             2545            |       |      440      |
|            **A**            |       |     **B**     |

* Now, rather than just pricing a house based on their size, you might say, `Well, let's also collect data on the number of bedrooms of this house`. In Below example, `A` can be both of these first two columns, and B" can be just the price of the house.

| Size of House (Square Feet) | # of Bedrooms | Price ($1000) |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|             523             |       1       |       115     |
|             645             |       1       |       150     |
|             708             |       2       |       210     |
|             1034            |       3       |       280     |
|             2290            |       4       |       355     |
|             2545            |       4       |       440     |
|            **A**            |     **A**     |     **B**     |

**_Note:_** So, given that table of data, given the dataset, it's actually up to you, up to your business use case to decide what is "A" and what is "B". Data is often unique to your business, and this is an example of a dataset that a rural state agency might have that they tried to help price houses._**

| Size of House (Square Feet) | # of Bedrooms | Price ($1000) |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|             523             |       1       |       115     |
|             645             |       1       |       150     |
|             708             |       2       |       210     |
|             1034            |       3       |       280     |
|             2290            |       4       |       355     |
|             2545            |       4       |       440     |
|             **B**           |     **B**     |     **A**     |

* In this above example it shows, if you have a certain budget and you want to decide what is the size of house you can afford, then you might decide that the input `A` is how much does someone spend and `B` is just the size of the house in square feet

## Acquiring Data

But how do you get data? How do you acquire data? Well, one way to get data is:

### 1. Manual Labeling

For example, you might collect a set of pictures like these over here, and then you might either yourself or have someone else go through these pictures and label each of them. So, the first one is a cat, second one is not a cat, third one is a cat, fourth one is not a cat. By manually labeling each of these images, you now have a dataset for building a cat detector. Manual labeling is a tried and true way of getting a dataset where you have both A and B.
**Note:**

* To do that, you actually need more than four pictures
* Manual Labeling Example From _"AI For Everyone.pptx, page 35"_.

### 2. Observing User Behaviors / Other Types of Behaviors

#### i. Human Behaviors

For example, let's say you run a website that sells things online where you offer things to users at different prices, and you want to observe if they buy your product or not.

Just through the act of either buying or not buying your product, you may be able to collected a data set where you can store the **_User ID_**,**the _time_ the user visited your website**, **the _price_ you offer** and **whether or not they _purchased_ it**. So, just by using your website, users can generate this data from you.

| USER ID    |     Time        | Price ($) |   Purchased   |
| :--------: | :----------:    | :-------: |  :---------:  |
|    4783    | Jan 21 08:15:20 |    7.98   |      yes      |
|    9893    | Mar 3  11:30:15 |   10.00   |      yes      |
|    8384    | Jun 11 08:15:05 |    8.98   |      no       |
|    0931    | Aug 2  20:30:55 |   12.90   |      yes      |
|    **A**   |      **A**      |   **A**   |      **B**    |

#### ii. Machine Behaviors

If you run a large machine in a factory and you want to predict if a machine is about to fail or have a fault, then just by observing the behavior of a machine, you can then record a dataset.
There's a machine ID, there's a temperature of the machine, there's a pressure within the machine, and then did the machine fail or not.

**Note:**

* observing behaviors of machines Example From _"AI For Everyone.pptx, page 37"_.

### 3. Download From Websites / Partnerships

* Thanks to the open internet you can find so many datasets available for free online
  * Computer vision or image datasets
  * Self driving car datasets
  * Speech recognition datasets
  * Medical imaging datasets

## Use and Mis-Use of Data

Two of the most common misuses or the bad ways of thinking about data

1. First we gether a lot of data, let say in 2 or 3 years. And then we will do AI. It turns out to be very bad strategy.
Once you've started collecting some data, go ahead and start showing it or feeding it to an AI team.
Then the AI team can give feedback to your IT team on what types of data to collect and what types of IT infrastructured to keep on building.
For **E.g.**
Maybe an AI team can look at your factory data and say, "Hey. You know what? If you can collect data from this big manufacturing machine, not just once every ten minutes, but instead once every one minute, then we could do a much better job building a preventative maintenance systems for you.”

2. If the company or anyone has a lot of data =, and they think that AI team can make it valuable . Unfortunately, this doesn't always work out. More data is usually better than less data, but we can't tak this as granted that just because you have many terabytes or gigabytes of data, that an AI team can actually make that valuable.

**Note:** Don't throw data at an AI team and assume it will be valuable.

## Data is Messsy

* Garbage in , Garbage Out
  * if you have bad data, then the AI will learn inaccurate things.

* Data Problems  
  * Incorrect Labels -> House will not sell for just 0.0001
  * Missing values

**_Example of Data Problems:_**

| Size of House (Square Feet) | # of Bedrooms | Price ($1000) |
| :-------------------------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |
|             523             |       1       |       115     |
|             645             |       1       |       0.0001  |
|             708             |       Unknown |       210     |
|             1034            |       3       |       Unknown |
|             Unknown         |       4       |       355     |
|             2545            |       Unknown |       440     |
_Note:_ Tables are the example of structured data. That basically means data that lives in a giant spreadsheet.

* Multiple Types Of Data
  
  * immages, audio, text
    _Note:_ immages, audio and text called usntrutured data.

**_Note:_** Techniques for dealing with unstructured data are little bit different than the techniques for dealing with structured data. But AI techniques can work very well for both of these types of data, unstructured data and structured data.
