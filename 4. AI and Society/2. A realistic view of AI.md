# A realistic view of AI

it is important that we have a realistic view of AI and be neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic.

## Goldilocks rule for AI

* Neither too optimistic
  * Having an unrealistic view of AI technologies may make people think that sentience or super intelligence, artificial, general intelligence is coming soon.

* Nor too pessimistic.
  * There are some things AI cannot do and so, another AI winter is coming.
  **Note:** The term AI winter refers to a couple of episodes in history when AI had been over-hyped and when people figured out that AI couldn't do everything that they thought it would. It resulted in a loss of faith and a decrease in investment in AI.

* Just right: Neither too optimistic nor too pessimistic something in-between is just right
  * AI can't do everything, but will transform industries and society.

## Limitations of AI

* Performance limitations
  * Given a small amount of data

* Explainability is hard (sometimes  doable)
Meaning that it works very well but the AI doesn't know how to explain why it does what it does.

  * Humans are also not good at explaining how we make decisions ourselves.
  * Lack of explainability is sometimes a barrier to its acceptance

* Biased AI through biased data
* Adverarial attacks on AI
