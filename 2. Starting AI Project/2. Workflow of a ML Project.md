# Workflow of a machine learning project

First of all we would discuss about an AI Products
**_Example: Speech Recognition_**

Let's asume one of us has any one of the following gadget.

* Amazon _Echo / Alexa_
* Google _Home_
* Apple _Siri_
* Baidu _DuerOS_

So, how do you build a speech recognition system that can recognize when you say, "Alexa," or "Hey, Google," or "Hey, Siri," or "Hello, Baidu"?

## Key Steps of a Machine Learning Project

We will take _Echo / Alexa_ as an example to understand `Key Steps for Machine Learning Project`

1. If you want to build an AI system or build a machine learning system to figure out when a user has said the word Alexa, **the first step is to collect data**.
   1. To collect data you miht go to few and ask them to say word "Alexa", and you record the audio for that.
   2. ou'll also get a bunch of people to say other words like "Hello," or say lots of other words and record the audio of that as well.

2. **Train The Model**
   1. Means you will use a machine learning algorithm to learn an input to output or A to B mapping, where the input A would be an audio clip.
