# Workflow of a machine learning project

First of all we would discuss about an AI Products
**_Example: Speech Recognition_**

Let's asume one of us has any one of the following gadget.

* Amazon _Echo / Alexa_
* Google _Home_
* Apple _Siri_
* Baidu _DuerOS_

So, how do you build a speech recognition system that can recognize when you say, "Alexa," or "Hey, Google," or "Hey, Siri," or "Hello, Baidu"?

## Key Steps of a Machine Learning Project

We will take _Echo / Alexa_ as an example to understand `Key Steps for Machine Learning Project`

1. If you want to build an AI system or build a machine learning system to figure out when a user has said the word Alexa, **the first step is to collect data**.
   1. To collect data you miht go to few and ask them to say word "Alexa", and you record the audio for that.
   2. you'll also get a bunch of people to say other words like "Hello," or say lots of other words and record the audio of that
   3. Labelled Voice

2. **Train The Model**
   1. Means you will use a machine learning algorithm to learn an input to output or A to B mapping, where the input A would be an audio clip.
   In the case of the first audio clip above, hopefully, it will tell you that the user said "Alexa".
   In the case of audio clip two, the system will learn to recognize that the user has said "Hello."

   2. **_Iterate_** many times until good enough.
3. Deploy Model
